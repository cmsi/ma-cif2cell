Description: CIF2Cell - Generating cells for electronic structure calculations from CIF files
 CIF2Cell is a tool to generate the geometrical setup for various electronic
 structure codes from a CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) file.
 The program currently supports output for a number of popular electronic
 structure programs, including ABINIT, ASE, CASTEP, CP2K, CPMD, CRYSTAL09,
 Elk, EMTO, Exciting, Fleur, FHI-aims, Hutsepot, MOPAC, Quantum Espresso,
 RSPt, Siesta, SPR-KKR, VASP. Also exports some related formats like .coo,
 .cfg and .xyz-files. The program has been published in Computer Physics
 Communications 182 (2011) 1183â€“1186. Please cite generously.
